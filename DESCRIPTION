Description: epiCleanr is specifically designed to meet the requirements of 
             epidemiologists and public health data experts. It offers a 
             comprehensive suite of functionalities for importing, cleaning, 
             unit testing, visualizing, and preprocessing dataâ€”tasks that are 
             frequently encountered in epidemiological analysis. By focusing on 
             addressing the unique challenges inherent in epidemiological 
             datasets, epiCleanr enhances both the efficiency and 
             reproducibility of your work.
