\description{
This function transforms a variable name into a standard, cleaned format.
The transformation includes converting to lower case, replacing spaces and
punctuation with underscores, replacing uppercase characters following
lowercase characters (camel case) with lowercase characters separated by an
underscore, and removing leading or trailing underscores.  The function is
inspired by the \code{janitor::clean_names()} function from the janitor
package.
